# Android ML Application using MediaPipe and TensorFlow Lite

This project is an Android application that utilizes machine learning models powered by TensorFlow Lite and MediaPipe for real-time image and video analysis. The application aims to demonstrate the integration of machine learning models for tasks such as pose detection, hand tracking, or face mesh detection, leveraging the efficiency and performance benefits of TensorFlow Lite for mobile devices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Perform real-time detection of human poses, hands, or face meshes using the MediaPipe library.
- **TensorFlow Lite Integration**: Run pre-trained models efficiently on Android devices using TensorFlow Lite, optimized for performance and low latency.
- **Camera Feed Processing**: Capture and process camera input in real time to apply machine learning models.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for Android devices, with TensorFlow Lite reducing the computational load and improving performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Android**: The application is developed using the Android SDK.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework for building cross-platform multimedia processing pipelines, which provides powerful and pre-trained models for hand tracking, face detection, pose estimation, and more.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: A lightweight solution for running machine learning models on mobile devices. It is a part of the TensorFlow ecosystem optimized for on-device inference.
- **OpenGL**: Used for drawing the overlay of detection results on camera frames.

## Prerequisites
